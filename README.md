My presentation on PDFKit from 360iDev 2019, along with sample code.

The code is intentionally simplified, and contains stuff you shouldn’t do in real code, like force unwraps.

I also realized the sample project is iPad only. I’ll fix that so it builds for iPhone shortly. There’s nothing iPad specific in PDFKit; I was just lazy when making the Storybord.

I'll add the video recording once released.
